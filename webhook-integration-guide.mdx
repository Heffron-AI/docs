# 1. Overview

This document describes how to integrate with our AI Phone Answering Agents webhook system. Our system sends real-time updates about phone call interactions to your endpoint through HTTP POST requests.

### Prerequisites

- A publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint
- Ability to process JSON payloads
- Authentication credentials (provided separately)

<Info>
**What is not in this document:**
1. The API docs are not in this document. We are working on making the endpoints public by the end of Q4 2024.
2. The developer testing account provided alongside this document has limited functionalities. Most importantly, it only has 1 agent connected to 1 phone number.

**Notes:**
1. The schemas provided in this document are still unstable as of the time of writing. We are actively improving our system.
</Info>



# 2. Webhook Setup

<Tip>
Please contact [adam@heffron.ai](mailto:adam@heffron.ai) to obtain a testing account.
</Tip>


## 2.1 Configuring Your Webhook URL on the platform

1. Log in to your dashboard at `[testing environment url]` on your computer. 
2. On the sidebar, navigate to the footer **Developer Tools**
    1. Developer Tools are currently unavailable on mobile view.
3. Under `Your Webhook Secret` click "+" to create a new webhook secret.
4. Fill in the following details:
    - Webhook URL: Your HTTPS endpoint that will receive the events
5. Store your webhook secret securely - you'll need it to verify incoming requests

# 3. Authentication

## 3.1 Headers

All webhook requests include the following authentication headers:

```
X-Webhook-Signature: [HMAC signature]
```

## 3.2 Verification

An example FastAPI server for Webhook Receiving (inclu. signature verification) can be found below:

```python
# A QUICK PYTHON SERVER FILE TO PROCESS INCOMING WEBHOOK, as a proof of concept
# run server via `$ uvicorn webhook_receiver:app --port 8080 --reload`

from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException, status
import hmac
import hashlib
import time
import logging
import json

app = FastAPI()
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

WEBHOOK_SECRET = "whsec_HREmNnq5mKLlFNh1l9RO5Zi8wdcuaggf6l67e0Uqjn0"
MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF = 300  # 5 mins

def verify_signature(payload_body: str, signature: str, timestamp: str) -> bool:
    """
    Helper fnc to verify the webhook signature and timestamp
    """
    try:
        timestamp_int = int(timestamp)
        current_time = int(time.time())
        if abs(current_time - timestamp_int) > MAX_TIMESTAMP_DIFF:
            logger.warning(
                f"Webhook timestamp too old. Current time: {current_time}, "
                f"Webhook time: {timestamp_int}, "
            )
            return False
    except ValueError:
        logger.error(f"Invalid timestamp format: {timestamp}")
        return False

    expected_signature = hmac.new(
        WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode('utf-8'),
        payload_body.encode('utf-8'),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, signature)

@app.post("/webhook/receive")
async def receive_webhook(request: Request):
    """
    Endpoint to receive the webhooks
    """
    body = await request.body()
    payload_body = body.decode()
    
    signature = request.headers.get("X-Webhook-Signature")
    timestamp = request.headers.get("X-Webhook-Timestamp")
    
    if not signature or not timestamp:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
            detail="Missing signature or timestamp"
        )
    
    if not verify_signature(payload_body, signature, timestamp):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Invalid signature"
        )
    
    try:
        data = json.loads(payload_body)
        logger.info(f"Received valid webhook: {json.dumps(data, indent=2)}")
        return {"status": "success", "message": "Webhook received and verified"}
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
            detail="Invalid JSON payload"
        )

```

# 4. Webhook Events

Our system emits the following event types:

| Event Type | Description | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `call_ended` | Call has completed | When a phone call ends |

# 5. Error Handling

### Retry Policy

- Failed deliveries are retried a total of 3 times
- Backoff delay between retries: 5 seconds
- Webhook timeout threshold: 10 seconds

### Error Response Code

The following are HTTP Code descriptions related to Webhook transmission, given that a `webhook_url` and webhook secret has already been set by user via the platform. 

| HTTP Code | Meaning | Action Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | Webhook has been successfully sent and received. | None. |
| 4xx | Client Error | Fix Integration on Client Side. |
| 5xx | Server Error | Request will be retried. |
