## Temporarily Disable (Preferred Method)
1. Log in to your account at [platform.voqo.ai](https://platform.voqo.ai)
2. Navigate to the "Agents" tab
3. Toggle the `Agent Disable` switch to disable your agent. This will temporarily disable call forwarding

<Note>
If disabled, the agent will not answer the call, but will still be connected. Your normal voicemail will not be back on.

## Permanently Disable
### Quick Method (Works for Most Carriers)

1. Open your phone's dialer app
2. Dial `##002#`
3. Press the call button
4. Wait for the confirmation message that call forwarding has been disabled

### Alternative Methods

If the quick method doesn't work, try these carrier-specific codes:

- `#21#` - Disables all call forwarding
- `##21#` - Alternative disable code (some carriers)

If you're having trouble disabling call forwarding:

1. Verify that you entered the code exactly as shown (including all # symbols)
2. Make sure you have good cellular reception
3. Try restarting your phone and attempting again
4. If still unsuccessful, contact your carrier's customer service
