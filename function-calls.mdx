During the conversation with a caller, you can configure your agent to perform certain actions at the request of the caller. This is done by configuring the various function calls available.

This guide covers how to define and customize function calls for your AI agent.

This Function Call feature is displayed on the Platform dashboard alongside the [Custom Prompt](conversation-prompts#custom-prompts) feature.

## End Call
End Call is a simple function call in which the Agent intelligently determines when to end the call based on the conversation with the caller.

It's free of cost and available for all agents.

#### Transition Message
Users can customize the goodbye message that the Agent delivers to the caller before ending the call.

## Transfer Call
The Transfer Call function allows the agent to transfer the call to another number, at the request of the caller. It is available for all agents.

Each Transfer Call request is charged at a cost of 10 credits. Once the transferred call is in progress, it will be charged at a rate of 40 credits per minute, independently from the initial AI call.

#### Transition Message
Custom message the Agent delivers to the caller before attempting to transfer the call to the desired transferee.

#### Display Agent Caller ID
Whether the transferree should see the Agent's phone number or the caller's phone number in the dialled call.

#### Warm vs Cold Transfer
Select between either Warm or Cold transfer.
Warm transfer allows the transferree to hear a summary of the previous AI call whilst the call is still connecting. This way the transferree can be provided some context of the previous call.
Cold transfer has no summary of the previous call.

#### Transferrable Contacts
A list of contacts the agents can transfer the call to. The contacts are mapped between name and number

The agent can use the name in the conversation to help caller identify whom they wish to transfer the call to.

> <u>NOTE</u>: The numbers must entered in E.164 format, and we only support Australian numbers at the moment. I.e. +614XXXXXXXX for mobile, or +61XYYYYYYYY for landline where X is not 4.
