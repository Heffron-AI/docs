**Batch Uploads** allow you to import a list of recipients for your outbound calling campaigns. Each upload can include dynamic parameters—such as name, department, or job position—which are mapped to agent prompts, enabling your AI agent to personalize conversations for each recipient. This makes every interaction more relevant and engaging.

Each batch upload contains important metadata, including the file name, file size, and the total number of contacts in the upload. Organizing your uploads with clear, descriptive names helps you easily track and manage your campaigns.

## How It Works

1. Click the **Batch Uploads** button in the sidebar to view all your uploaded recipient lists.
