    Important Update to Your Voqo AI Subscription

    We've updated our pricing model to switch from minute-based billing to credit-based pricing. 
    This way, as we introduce more features, you only need to pay for the features you are using.

    New credit structure:
    - Per minute call is 20 credits
    - Per post-call SMS is 25 credits
    - Additional credits are charged at $0.01 each.

    New pricing plans:
    - Free (limited access to features + 500 credits)
    - $5 (full access to features + 500 credits)
    - $15 (full access to features + 1600 credits)
    - $50 (full access to features + 60000 credits)

    Newly registered accounts (from 10th of January 2025) will now use the new pricing model. 

    For legacy accounts (registered before the 10th of January 2025), we will be transitioning 
    these accounts to our new pricing model, which provides better transparancy on usage.

    Starting 20th of February 2025, 30 days from now, we'll be transitioning all accounts to our new pricing structure.

    If you were on the free plan, you will be transitioned to the new free plan. 
    If you were on the $30 per month plan (50 minutes), you will be transitioned to the new $15 (1600 credits) per month plan.
    If you were on the $50 per month plan (100 minutes), you will be transitioned to the new $50 (6000 credits) per month plan.

    In the mean time, we also introduced many new features and improvements that can be found
