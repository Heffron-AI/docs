<Update label="10th of January 2024">
    We've updated our pricing model to switch from minute-based billing to credit-based pricing. This way, as we introduce more 
    features, you only need to pay for the features you are using. 
    [Learn more here](https://www.voqo.ai/pricing)

    As shown in the [pricing page](https://www.voqo.ai/pricing), each feature has a credit value. 
    - Per minute of call: 20 credits (rounded up to the nearest second)
    - Per post-call sms: 25 credits
