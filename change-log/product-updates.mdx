      - 10 credits for email summary 
      - 20 credits for SMS summary 
      - Limit to a maximum of 10 post-call actions
    </ol>

  ## 2. Tweaks and Improvements
    - **Ring, ring. Hello?**: We've screwed some shiny new bolts on the **Call Log** tab. Access full audio recordings of your AI agent's conversations and review post-call results to better track your usage.
