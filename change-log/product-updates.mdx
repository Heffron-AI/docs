<Update label="11th of February 2024">
  With our second update of the new year, we wanted to share our new features across agent customisation and contact creation options.

  ## 1. New Features
    - **Custom Conversation Prompts**: Love the templates we have but want to take your agent one step further? Now you have full control over how conversations are run by your Voqo agent.
    Customise the full system prompt with our best practice guide to create your perfect use case. Let us know what you cook up on our WhatsApp group!

    - **Support for multiple post call actions**: We've updated our post-call capabilities to support sending Email and SMS summaries at the same time. Of course, you can still choose to have either just SMS or Email summaries.
    <ol>
      - 10 credits for email summary 
      - 20 credits for SMS summary 
      - Limit to a maximum of 10 post-call actions
    </ol>

    - **New Voices:** Choose from our new voices: 'Male-friendly' and 'Female-friendly' to level your agent and put a smile on the face of your callers! Accessible through the agent customisation tab.

  ## 2. Tweaks and Improvements
    - **Ring, ring. Hello?**: We've screwed some shiny new bolts on the **Call Log** tab. Access full audio recordings of your AI agent's conversations and review post-call results to better track your usage.

  ## 1. Pricing Model
    We've updated our pricing model to switch from minute-based billing to credit-based pricing. This way, as we introduce more 
    features, you only need to pay for the features you are using. 
    [Learn more here](https://www.voqo.ai/pricing)

    As shown in the pricing page, each feature has a credit value.

    - Per minute of call: 20 credits (rounded up to the nearest second)
    - Per post-call sms: 25 credits

  ## 2. New Features
    - **Conversation Templates**: We recognised that our users are using the Smart Voicemail for a variety of use cases. We added conversation templates so you 
    can pick the template that best fits your use case. We will be adding more templates in the future. If you are an existing user, you will need to login to your account [](https://platform.heffron.ai)
    Disable Agent: You can now temporilly disable the agent from the dashboard.
    - **Auto Contact Creation (paid feature)**: Paid users can now automatically create contacts from the voicemails they receive. The contact name will be displayed in the post-call summary.

  ## 3. Improvements
  - **Improved Conversation Flow**: We've made some improvements to the conversation flow to Smart Voicemail to make it more concise and polite. You will need to select a template to see the changes.
  - **Improved Dashboard**: We've made some improvements to the dashboard to make it easier to navigate and find the information you need.
  - **Call recoridng**: You can now view the call recordings in the call logs.
  ## 4. Restrictions
  - **Free Plan**: Free plans now have 500 credits per month. Once the credits run out, you agent will be turned off. If you need more credits, you can upgrade to a paid plan.
  - **Feature Restrictions**: Some features are only available to paid users. Free users will no longer have visibility to view call logs. You can see the full list of features [here](https://www.voqo.ai/pricing)
