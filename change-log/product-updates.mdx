  Happy New Year! We hope you had a great holiday season. We have some exciting updates to share with you.
  
  ## 1. Pricing Model
    We've updated our pricing model to switch from minute-based billing to credit-based pricing. This way, as we introduce more 
    features, you only need to pay for the features you are using.

  ## 2. New Features
    - **Conversation Templates**: We recognised that our users are using the Smart Voicemail for a variety of use cases. We added conversation templates so you 
    can pick the template that best fits your use case. We will be adding more templates in the future. If you are an existing user, you will need to login to your account [](https://platform.heffron.ai)
    Disable Agent: You can now temporilly disable the agent from the dashboard.
    - **Auto Contact Creation (paid feature)**: Paid users can now automatically create contacts from the voicemails they receive. The contact name will be displayed in the post-call summary.

  ## 3. Improvements
  - **Improved Conversation Flow**: We've made some improvements to the conversation flow to Smart Voicemail to make it more concise and polite. You will need to select a template to see the changes.
  - **Improved Dashboard**: We've made some improvements to the dashboard to make it easier to navigate and find the information you need.
  - **Call recoridng**: You can now view the call recordings in the call logs.
  ## 4. Restrictions
  - **Free Plan**: Free plans now have 500 credits per month. Once the credits run out, you agent will be turned off. If you need more credits, you can upgrade to a paid plan.
