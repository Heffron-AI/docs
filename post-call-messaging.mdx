### SMS
When enabled, you will receive a **text message** containing key details about each call. The SMS includes:
- The **Caller ID** (phone number of the caller).
- The **Contact Name**, if the number is saved.
- A **conversation summary**, which provides a quick overview of the call.

SMS notifications are a great way to get instant updates without checking your email. However, since SMS messages have limited space, details like transcripts and call recordings are only available via email.

### Email
Choosing email notifications provides **everything in SMS**, plus: 
- The **phone type** (mobile, landline, or VoIP).
- The **call duration**, showing how long the conversation lasted.
- A **full transcript** of the call for complete context.
- A **recording URL** allowing you to listen to the entire conversation.
  > *Call recordings are saved for up to 6 months. <a href="mailto:adam@heffron.ai?subject=Request to Remove Call Recording">Contact us</a> if you need to remove a recording sooner*.

Emails offer a more comprehensive record of your conversations, making them ideal for documentation and review purposes.
