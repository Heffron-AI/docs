The **Post-Call Actions** feature allows you to receive a summary of every call your AI agent picks up, delivered via SMS, Email, Webhook, or all three. 

Enabling both SMS and Email notifications will result in **higher credit usage**.

### SMS
When enabled, you will receive a **text message** containing key details about each call. The SMS includes:
- The **Caller ID** (phone number of the caller).
- The **Contact Name**, if the number is saved.
- A **conversation summary**, which provides a quick overview of the call.

SMS notifications are a great way to get instant updates without checking your email. However, since SMS messages have limited space, details like transcripts and call recordings are only available via email.

### Email
Choosing email notifications provides **everything in SMS**, plus: 
- The **phone type** (mobile, landline, or VoIP).
- The **call duration**, showing how long the conversation lasted.
- A **full transcript** of the call for complete context.
- A **recording URL** allowing you to listen to the entire conversation.
<Note>
Call recordings are saved for up to 6 months. <a href="mailto:adam@heffron.ai?subject=Request to Remove Call Recording">Contact us</a> if you need to remove a recording sooner.
</Note>

Emails offer a more comprehensive record of your conversations, making them ideal for documentation and review purposes.

### Webhook
Configuring webhook post call messages provides **all call information**, which is **everything in email**, plus: 
- The **status of the call**, whether it was "completed", "failed", or another outcome.
- The **call start and end times**, indicating exactly when the conversation began and concluded.
- The **results of post-call actions**, showing the outcomes of the other configured post call actions, if any.
- The **timestamps for key conversation events**, detailing when significant moments occurred during the call.

Webhook notifications deliver a complete JSON payload to your specified endpoint once a call ends. Unlike SMS or Email—which provide formatted text summaries—webhooks offer the raw, structured call data for full integration into your systems, which is perfect if you need:
- **Real-Time Data Integration:** Instantly process call data in your internal systems, dashboards, or third-party applications.
- **Automation:** Trigger custom workflows or alerts based on specific call events.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Store detailed call records for further analysis without manual intervention.

<Warning>
A **Webhook Secret** must be configured if you wish to verify the webhook signature. This can be done on the platform's <a href="https://platform.voqo.ai/developer_tools">Developer Tools</a> section.

### SMS to Caller
The **SMS to Caller** feature allows your agent to automatically send a follow-up SMS to the person who chatted with your AI agent, after every call.

#### How it works:
- **Free Tier:**
  - The message is always Voqo-branded and cannot be customized.
  - The SMS includes:
    - Your number the caller rang
    - A summary of the call
    - Voqo's end call growth loop (if the caller expresses interest)
    - Voqo AI's branding and signup link
  - **Cost:** Free (no credits charged)
- **Paid Tier:**
  - You can fully customize the message sent to your callers, utilising the allowed template variables (`call_summary`, `your_number`, `agent_number` and `agent_name`).
  - If you leave the message field empty, the default Voqo-branded message is used (same as Free Tier, and still free).
  - If you enter a custom message, your message is sent **exactly as written** (template variables will be dynamically filled, but no Voqo branding or growth loop appended), and you are charged **20 credits** per SMS.
  - **Cost:** 20 credits per custom message; free if using the default.

#### Growth Loop Logic
- The Voqo-branded message (default) includes a smart growth loop:
  - If the caller expresses interest in learning more about the AI agent, the SMS will include a line inviting them to sign up for Voqo AI.
  - This is detected automatically by analyzing the call transcript.
- If you use a custom message, **the growth loop and branding are not appended**—your message is sent as-is.

#### Non-Interactive Calls
- If the call transcript does **not** contain any human input (i.e., the agent only spoke to voicemail or silence), **no SMS to caller is sent** and no credits are charged.

#### Why use SMS to Caller?
- **Drive more signups:** The viral loop in the default message helps spread awareness of your business and Voqo AI.
- **Professional follow-up:** Paid users can send branded, personalized follow-ups to every caller.
- **No surprises:** You only pay for custom messages; the default is always free.

<Info>
You can enable or disable the SMS to Caller action for each agent, and configure the message and End Call Growth Loop settings in your agent's dashboard.
