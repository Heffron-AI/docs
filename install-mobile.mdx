# Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Overview

The Voqo AI platform can be installed as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, providing mobile users with a seamless, app-like experience directly from their browser. Once installed on the home screen, the platform launches in full-screen mode and behaves like a native mobile app.

> **Coming Soon**: Push notification alerts for missed calls and updates.
