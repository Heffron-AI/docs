## What are Memories?
Memories let your agent remember caller-specific facts (e.g., name, preferences, past requests) across calls. Memories are stored and retrieved per Contact.

- Saved automatically after calls (if enabled)
- Retrieved during live calls to personalize responses (if enabled)
- Visible in each Contact's “Long-term Memories” section

## Requirements
- Memories are linked to a specific Contact. The caller must:
  - Match an existing Contact, or
  - You enable “Automatic contact creation” in Contact Settings.
- This feature is available on paid plans.

## Enable Memories (Agent Dashboard)
In the Agent dashboard, scroll down to “Memory Settings”:
- Save conversation memories: When enabled, the agent will save new/updated memories after each call.
- Use conversation memories: When enabled, the agent will retrieve relevant memories during a live call.

<Warning>
Memories are saved and retrieved per Contact. If no matching Contact exists, enable “Automatic contact creation” in Contact Settings so the caller is captured as a Contact.
</Warning>

## How it Works (under the hood)
- Save (post-call): The call transcript is analyzed to extract caller-specific facts, and those are saved as long-term memories scoped to that Contact.
- Use (during call): The agent retrieves relevant memories scoped to that Contact and uses them as internal context to improve responses. This information is not read aloud to the caller.

## View Memories in Contacts
Open “Contacts” → select a Contact → scroll to “Long-term Memories” to see the saved memories and when they were last updated.

## Tips
- Turn on both:
  - Automatic Contact Creation (in Contact Settings)
  - Save conversation memories (in Memory Settings)
- Keep using “Use conversation memories” for personalization and faster task completion.
- You can revisit memories per Contact to curate and audit what the agent knows.
