Under the 'Conversation Settings' section, you can select from the 'Prompt Templates' or 'Custom Prompt' tabs.

## Prompt Templates
In the Prompt Templates section you can update:
- One of three preset templates in the toggle down button
- Name of the Human (your name)
- The name of your AI agent
- The AI agent's opening sentence (the same sentence is repeated across of every call picked up)

## Custom Prompts
In the Custom Prompt section you have full control over:
- The AI agent's opening sentence
- The full conversation flow and instructions for how the AI agent picks up calls
- Optionally generate dynamic start sentences for each call, in similar nature to `Opening Sentence`, and also include the caller's name if pre-configured as a [Contact](/add-and-update-contacts).
