## Key Benefits

- Provides visibility into call outcomes for stakeholders
- Reduces the need for real-time supervision

## How It Works

When a call ends, the platform processes any configured post-call actions. If "Send Email Summary" is enabled:

- An email is dispatched to the destination email address.
- The email includes:
    - Summary of the call
    - Full call transcript
    - Link to call recording (if enabled)
- Requires a valid email address and uses the platformâ€™s outbound messaging infrastructure.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to **Agent Settings**.
2. Scroll to **Post-call Actions**.
3. Click the **+** icon and select **Email Summary**.
4. Enter the desired email address.
5. Click **Add** to save the configuration.

## Use Cases
