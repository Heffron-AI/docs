A **Campaign** in Voqo AI serves as an abstract grouping that maps to your real-world marketing or outreach initiatives. Campaigns provide a structured way to organize, manage, and track your batch outbound calls, ensuring clarity and efficiency as you scale your communication efforts.

By associating each batch of outbound calls with a specific campaign, you can easily monitor progress, analyze results, and maintain a clear overview of your ongoing and past activities.

## How It Works

1. Click the **Campaigns** button in the navbar to view a list of all created campaigns.
