It's time to give your agent some personality and a role in the universe!

## Agent Settings
In the agent settings section you can update:
- Your Agent's name
- Agent Voice (choose from our collection of 6 male and female voices!)
- Whether to enable or disable your agent (if you disable the agent, it will not respond to calls)
